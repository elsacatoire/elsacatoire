Hi, I'm Elsa! 👋

🚀 About Me
I'm currently learning web/software development at Ada Tech School in Nantes. I have a passion for both mountains and coding. My dream is to code for a greener and more accessible world, right from my favorite mountain. I am looking for a one-year apprenticeship starting in October or November 2023.

🙋‍♀️ Few things about me:

👩‍💻 I'm currently focusing on practicing tests and clean code techniques.

🧠 I'm really enjoying learning Python, and I'll soon start diving into Django!

👯‍♀️ I'm eager to collaborate on social and eco-friendly projects.

🤔 I'm also looking for help with coding a chatbot that will help women feel safe.

💬 Feel free to ask me about my favorite food. Spoiler alert: I can't choose, but I've traveled enough to talk about it for hours.

📫 The best way to reach me is in person.

⚡️ Fun fact: I used to be a trapeze teacher!
